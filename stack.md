I specialize in building robust backend systems with a focus on AI orchestration and cloud-native infrastructure.

## Core Competencies

### Backend Engineering
- Java 17 / 21 (primary), Spring Boot (REST APIs, microservices, reactive), Spring Security (OAuth2, JWT, RBAC)
- Hibernate / JPA (ORM, entity modeling, query optimization)
- Express.js (Node.js APIs, middleware patterns)

### Generative AI & LLM Orchestration
- LangChain & LangGraph (chains, agents, tools, stateful graphs, memory)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines (chunking, embedding, vector stores, re-ranking)
- Prompt engineering, tool-calling agents, multi-step reasoning flows

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- Kubernetes (deployments, services, ingress, Helm charts, operators)
- Terraform (IaC for AWS/GCP/OCI, modules, state management)
- Docker (multi-stage builds, container optimization)
- OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure), Nginx (reverse proxy, load balancing)
- End-to-end CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins)

### Computer Vision & Data Processing
- Python (core language for AI/ML tooling)
- OpenCV (image preprocessing, feature detection, augmentation pipelines)
- NumPy / Pandas (data manipulation, array operations, ETL)

### Programming Languages & Databases
- Java, Python, TypeScript, SQL
- PostgreSQL / MySQL (schema design, indexing, transactions, JSONB)

### Frontend & UI Development
- React.js (functional components, hooks, context)
- React Native (cross-platform mobile)
- Tailwind CSS, Redux (state management), Material UI (component library)

## Approach & Focus Areas
- Production-grade systems: observability, fault tolerance, horizontal scaling
- Cloud-native principles: immutability, declarative config, GitOps
- AI integration patterns: secure LLM calling, cost control, evaluation frameworks
- End-to-end ownership: from infrastructure provisioning to model inference and API exposure
